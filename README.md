# e-auto.ge user/admin Dasbhoard üöô

Welcome my project, a web application designed with a focus on functionality and efficiency. In this project, my primary objective was to provide users with a seamless experience in managing their car listings, authentication processes, and empower administrators with tools to oversee and moderate user activities.

üöó Key Features:

User Authentication: This web-app ensures a secure environment by implementing user authentication, allowing users to access personalized features.
Car Listings Management: Users can effortlessly add, view, and delete their car listings, enhancing the overall user experience.
Admin Functionality: Administrators have advanced capabilities, such as checking user details, suspending or promoting users, and managing user accounts.

‚öôÔ∏è Under the Hood:

Efficient Functionality over UI: Unlike traditional projects prioritizing UI, I focused on delivering stable functionality. Efforts were invested in creating an efficient caching system, server-side pagination, MERN operations and in creating reusable code for a smooth and responsive user experience.
Technology Stack: The project leverages cutting-edge technologies, including NextJS with TypeScript, tailwind & nextui for styling, mongoose as the database system, zustand for state management, next-auth for authentication, and cloudinary as a Content Delivery Network (CDN).
